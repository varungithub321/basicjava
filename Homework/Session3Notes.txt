Git:
Git is a version control system where multiple persons can work on the same text document, combine them, and view the changes that were done, etc. 
In this class, Github will be used for notes, exercises, and quizzes.
Looking and referencing back will also be easy while using Github. 

A git repository is a collection of files and/or folders. 

To clone the repository onto your computer, 
cd\
md gitlearn
cd gitlearn
git clone aboveurl

Adding New Files:

After making a new file,
-Save the file into your repository folder on the computer
-Type in git status and this will show the changes that were done. 
-Type in git add and this will add the files into the local git. 
-Type git status again to see if the change was successfully completed
-git commit -m "Comment" will commit to push the file into the account
-git push origin master will push the file changes into the github account

Procedure for modifying the files is the same as adding new files.

Deleting Files:
Use 'del' command and then repeat the git commands again. 

Saving eclipse programs into the repository folder and repeating the same git commands would push the program folder into the local git.
