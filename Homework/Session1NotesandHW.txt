Session 1 Notes
- A computer is a machine that consists of hardware and software
- Hardware is something that is tangible about the computer, for example, a Mouse Keyboard, Motherboard, etc. 
-Software is something about the computer that is intangible. Some examples are OS X, Windows 10, etc. 

Parts of a computer:

CPU: 
- Short form for Central Processing Unit.
- Executes commands
- Like the human brain

RAM:
- Does the work needed temporarily, and it is "thrown away" after it completes the work.
-Like a "scratchpad" or "rough paper"

Hard Disk:
-Hard Disk stores and saves information permanently to which the computer refers back to.
-Like a reference textbook or notebook

Software:
Operating  System:
Users interact with this software to run other programs.


A program is a series of steps/ series of instructions that the computer 
uses to execute commands. 

Binary Number System:
The binary number system is a number system consisting of 0s and 1s and it is the language that a computer understands. After running a program, the computer will convert the program into binary language and then execute the command.

Converting binary to decimal:
Example- 11100111
-Take digit(0 or 1) and multiply it with 2 to the power of the number of terms minus 1(7 in this example) and add it to the next term, which would have an exponent 1 lower than the previous one(6), and so forth until the exponent is 0.
11100111:
(1 * 2^7) + (1 * 2^6) + (1 * 2^5) + (0 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) +(1 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)
= 128 + 64 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 1
=231

Converting decimal to binary:
Make sure the number is additions of the exponents with the base 2. 
83: 
64 + 16 + 2 + 1
As 2^2, 2^3 and 2^5 are missing they are counted as 0s
Starting from the end, 
1010011

Another code that computers can understand is ASCII(American Standarad Code Information Interchange)
