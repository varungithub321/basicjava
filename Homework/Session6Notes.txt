Session 6 Notes: 

Creating your own Data Type: 

You can create your own data type by making a class for it. Declaring variables which talk about the data type's properties will complete the creation of the data type. 
 
For Example: 
A person has
Age
Weight 
Height
Grade

Using your data type: 
Just like declaring a new scanner:

Person person1 = new Person();

And after this you can do 
person 1.age = 15;, and it also works with the different properties that you have declared for that data type.

General Rules: 
Every variable has to be declared before used. 

All statements that open with curly brackets should close with a closing curly bracket. 

Not every line of code ends with a semicolon. As only statements end with periods in English, every statement ends with a semicolon in Java.
