Session 4 Notes 

Variables can have values assigned to them, and the assigned value can keep changing. 

Constants are numbers that can never change. 

Data Types:
Numbers without Decimals - int(Integers)
The information stored in quotes - String
Numbers with decimals - Double 

Syntax:
Syntax is just like grammar in English language. 
Examples:
';' at the end of every statement
declaring variables requires data type, followed by the variable name, then '=', and then the value that is assigned to it.

Conditional Statements:
If, else if, and else statements are conditional statements that give a condition of one or more events that would not take place. 

Syntax
if(anything coming to true/false){}
else if(anything coming to true/false){}
else{}

Loops
For Loop:
Have a four part structure
1.Assigning the variable a value
2.Giving the variable a condition
3.Having an increment for the variable
4. The output that the loop should give out everytime the variable increments. 

Double Slash('//') comments the line that are in the program, and the computer doesn't see them. 

Ctrl+Shift+F can be used to correct indentation

If there is a syntax error, Eclipse will show a red circle to the left of the program, and it explains the syntax error that has been made. 

It is important that every block of code should have opening and closing curly brackets.
